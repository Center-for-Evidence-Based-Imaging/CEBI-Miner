## Getting Started with CEBI-Miner (WINDOWS VERSION)

These instructions will get you a copy of CEBI-miner up and running on your local machine ready for application.
Please download and extract the zip file for this repository on your computer.
-----------------------------------------------------------
### Step 1)

Skip to Step 2 if you already have python 3.6.6 installed on your computer. 

Navigate to the CEBI-Miner folder, right click on “1. Install Python.exe”, click "Run as administrator". Check the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" checkbox and click "Install Now". Once installation is complete proceed to Step 2.

-----------------------------------------------------------
### Step 2)

Right click on “2. Install Python Packages”, click "Run as administrator" and wait for the black command prompt screen to close. This may take a few minutes.

-----------------------------------------------------------
### Step 3)

Double click “3. Run the app” file. Do not close the black command prompt that will open. It should remain open during application use. Proceed to Step 4 after black command prompt screen says Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/

-----------------------------------------------------------
### Step 4) 

Double click on the “4. Open the webpage.bat” file. A webpage will open and you can start using the application.
The webpage will open in your default browser. We highly suggest opening this address (http://127.0.0.1:8050) on either chrome or firefox, and not Internet Explorer.

PS) The app is locally run on your machine and therefore no information leaves your computer. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
### Step 5)

When you are done using the application close the webpage and associated command prompt. 


After first use, start instructions from Step 3.
